    <div class="about-content">
      <p>What if the city itself could grow food? What if sidewalks, rooftops, and forgotten alleys weren’t just empty surfaces, but living infrastructure—quietly producing nutrition, shading streets, and creating new ways for people to gather?<br>
      This project reimagines urban farming as architecture, technology, and logistics all woven together. It’s a modular system of <span class="bold-green">aeroponic farming</span> pods—units that grow up to 2,500 plants a year while using <span class="bold-green">95% less water</span> than traditional farming. Placed on rooftops, in schoolyards, or along sidewalks, these pods transform unused urban space into productive, interactive ecosystems.<br>
      But hardware is only half the story. Behind it is a platform—an app that connects the entire system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buyers, who want ultra-fresh, hyperlocal produce.</li>
        <li>Caretakers, community growers who maintain the pods.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure managers, who keep the network running.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AI does 95% of the work, predicting demand, optimizing yields, routing deliveries. Humans handle the last 5%—the moments of care, maintenance, and ritual that keep the system alive.<br>
      It’s not just about growing food—it’s about <span class="bold-green">designing new civic rituals</span>. A school pod becomes a learning tool. A sidewalk pod sparks a Friday harvest market. A rooftop pod feeds an entire block.<br>
      This isn’t utopian. It’s a new layer of urban infrastructure, designed to scale without friction, merging design and sustainability into something cities can’t ignore.</p>
      <p class="about-highlight">This isn’t just farming. It’s rewriting how cities feed themselves.</p>
